# ðŸ“° News Feed Block

**News Feed Block** is a Gutenberg block-based WordPress plugin that displays live news articles from a public REST API (e.g., [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org)). Users can customize the feed by selecting a news category, country, source, and number of articles to display. The block fetches and renders articles dynamically on the frontend using modern React and WordPress block editor APIs.
